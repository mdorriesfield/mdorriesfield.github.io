		<h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
		<p><strong>Hello there!</strong> My name is Mark Dorriesfield, and I am a field biologist and lifelong naturalist from southern Ontario. 
		While I love all aspects of the natural world, birding has been my passion since elementary school. This drew ultimately me to attend the 
		University of Guelph and study Wildlife Biology and Conservation, and it was during my first summer of undergrad that I landed my first 
		field job: working with breeding Golden-winged Warblers in eastern Manitoba. The next year was even better, as I hopped on the Manitoba 
		Breeding Bird Atlas point counting crew. Getting paid to be outside, hike around, count birds, and travel to a new each location each day
		was a dream come true, and it set my path for close to a decade!</p>
		<p>Since then, I have spent each of the last <strong>9 seasons</strong> surveying breeding birds throughout North America. During that time
		I have travelled extensively in Manitoba, Nevada, and Arizona, and completed almost <strong>3500 avian point counts</strong> for environmental NGOs. Once I 
		was finished school in 2016, this allowed me the freedom to pick up field contracts other times of year, so I have spent 2 seasons surveying 
		migratory shorebirds on the coast of James Bay in Ontario, and 2 falls monitoring and banding birds on the north shore of Lake Superior.
		Add to this some one-off seasons, such as small mammal trapping in the mountains of Nevada, pre-development surveys in the GTA,
		and mortality monitoring at a wind farm in southwestern Ontario, and I have accumulated quite the list of experiences (and stories!) along the way.</p>

		<p>During the winters, when fieldwork is scarce in North America, my eyes turned to the wonders of the Neotropics. My first journey to that 
		part of the world was the winter of 2017-2018, where I volunteered for 2 months leading tours at the Monteverde Butterfly Gardens in Costa Rica.
		The next year when I was unable to secure a guiding position for the off-season, I decided to travel Ecuador on my own for 2.5 months, 
		gaining more tropical birding experience in that insanely diverse country. Finally, last fall I spent some time back in Costa Rica, helping out 
		at an off-grid eco-hostel on the Osa Peninsula. While there I guided the handful of rainy-season guests, and collected daily data for their 
		property’s eBird Hotspot (which I’d created on my first visit there 2 winters previous) in order to help promote their establishment to 
		visiting birders.</p>

		<p>It’s been a wild run! I’ve been lucky to visit, and return to, some amazing places as a part of some excellent research projects, had
		some priceless experiences and met amazing people. That said, the life of nomad can be tiring after a while, and the last few years I 
		have been thinking about staying back in Canada more long-term, and setting my eyes towards more permanent work. Honestly, I was going 
		to put off that decision one more year, as the Mexican Spotted Owls of southeast Arizona were calling me back for another season… but 
		covid put an end to those plans! Luckily, I had some online audio transcription work over the winter for Birds Canada, and was able to 
		pick up some environmental consulting contracts through the summer, and was able to stay afloat. However, with those seasons finished, 
		covid still raging worldwide and travel really not an option, it seemed like an excellent time to go back to school and re-tool myself 
		for more permanent work.</p>
		<p>This is where Fleming’s excellent GIS program came into the picture. While I have been on the data-collection end of research for
		many years now, I am eager and interested to learn the make use of those data once the field season comes to an end. Since most of 
		our environmental data have a spatial component, and maps have always been a love of mine, GIS seemed the perfect field of study to dive into.
		So here I am! In addition to spatial analysis, cartography, remote sensing and many other useful skills, I am also studying web design – 
		hence the creation of this webpage. I am very excited to build on all of these skills, and once I’m out of school (and covid has hopefully
		been put in its place), I can return to the workforce in a greater capacity with this new skillset.</p>
